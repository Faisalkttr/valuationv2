"""
Valuation metrics engine.

Given a ticker's price/revenue/shares history and a forward revenue
estimate, this module derives the same fields as the CG Power export:

  Current Revenue TTM, Current Market Cap, Current P/S
  Historical Median / 75th / 90th percentile P/S
  Forward Revenue Estimate, Forward Revenue Growth, Forward P/S
  Required Revenue to Normalise Valuation, Required Revenue Growth
  Growth Gap, Years to Normalise Multiple, Expectations Burden Score
  Expectations Classification, Target Multiple Value/Label
  Valuation Anchor Confidence / Observation Count

All functions here are pure (no network calls) so they're easy to unit
test -- fetch.py is responsible for getting real data into this shape.
